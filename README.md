# Cryptopals Crypto Challenges Writeups

This repository contains my detailed writeups for the Cryptopals Crypto Challenges. These challenges are designed to help understand and practice various cryptographic concepts and techniques. 

## Contents

- **Set 1:** Basics (Encoding, XOR, Fixed XOR, etc.)
- **Set 2:** Block Crypto (CBC Mode, ECB Detection, Padding, etc.)
- **Set 3:** Block & Stream Crypto (CTR, Random Access, etc.)
- **Set 4:** Stream Crypto & Randomness (MT19937, RSA, etc.)
- **Set 5:** Diffie-Hellman and Friends
- **Set 6:** RSA and DSA
- **Set 7:** Hashes and MACs
- **Set 8:** Abstract Algebra

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to document my learning journey and provide a reference for others working through the same challenges. Each writeup includes a description of the challenge, the approach taken to solve it, and the solution itself, with code snippets where applicable.
